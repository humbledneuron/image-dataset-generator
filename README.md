# image-dataset-generator
This is a Image dataset creator, just give it video which are recorded under different lighting condition, it'll create a huge image dataset for you, in mins

This basically uses OpenCV to read video and then extract frames from it, and then save it to a folder.


soon will develop CLI app for this, so that you can use it from terminal
as of now you use it by running the script 


## Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python



```
